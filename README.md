# 8086 Microprocessor Practicals

This repository contains **8086 Assembly Language Programs (ALP)** for basic arithmetic operations, array processing, and mini-project.  
The programs are written for the **Intel 8086 microprocessor** using **TASM**.

## 🚀 How to Run
### Using **EMU8086**
1. Open the `.asm` file in EMU8086.
2. Assemble the code (`Compile`).
3. Run the program (`Emulate`).
4. Observe **register values** and **memory dump** for output.

### Using **MASM/TASM**
1. Save your code as `program.asm`.
2. Open DOSBox or DOS terminal.
3. Assemble:
   ```bash
   masm program.asm;
4. Link:
  link program.obj;
5. Run:
  program.exe
